📖 Diary of an Emerging Data Analyst: The Reality of Data Quality Issues

# **Lessons from the Cannabis Sales Analysis Project 📊 **

## **Understanding Data Enrichment & Enhancement**

📌 Entry: The Day I Realized Not All Data is Created Equal

Today, I made the difficult decision to step away from my cannabis sales dataset after weeks of data wrangling, transformations, and validation efforts. While it’s frustrating, I also recognize the immense growth I’ve had during this process.

What I Learned Today:

1️⃣ Not all datasets are ready for analysis—sometimes, no amount of enrichment will fix fundamental structural issues.

2️⃣ Dataset transparency is crucial—without a clear methodology from the data provider, analysts are left to guess at how numbers were aggregated.

3️⃣ Data cleaning is only part of the challenge—some issues only become visible once you start visualizing and interrogating the data.

4️⃣ Knowing when to pivot is a skill—the ability to recognize when a dataset won’t yield reliable insights is just as important as knowing how to analyze it.

Rather than feeling discouraged, I’m taking this as an opportunity to refine my approach to evaluating datasets in the future. Every challenge I faced—whether it was dealing with rolling sales figures, creating logical product classifications, or troubleshooting missing values—was a hands-on lesson in real-world data analysis.

I’m leaving this project with sharper skills, a stronger sense of analytical integrity, and a deepened understanding of how critical data quality is in business intelligence.

Tomorrow, I pivot to a fresh dataset—this time, with clearer aggregation logic and well-structured date fields! 🚀

Final Thought:

Not all data projects end with a perfect dashboard or report—but every project is an opportunity to hone your craft as an analyst. This experience has prepared me for the next challenge, and I’m ready to apply these lessons to future data projects with confidence.

### **What I Tried**
- 🔹 Added a **Market Table** for better segmentation.
- 🔹 Connected a **Product Category Table** for classification.
- 🔹 Standardized **Month Ending Dates** to improve clarity.

### **Key Takeaways**
-  **Data integrity is everything!** If a dataset is unclear, analysis will be too.
-  **Enhancements must be verifiable.** Sometimes, adding context isn’t enough if the raw data itself lacks structure.
-  **Visualization can reveal hidden inconsistencies.** Bad data only becomes obvious when you attempt to structure it.

> **Final Thought:** Not every dataset leads to meaningful analysis, and that’s okay! The real skill lies in **knowing when to pivot** and apply lessons learned.
