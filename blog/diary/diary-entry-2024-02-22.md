# **Lessons from the Cannabis Sales Analysis Project**

## **Understanding Data Enrichment & Enhancement**
*(Introductory paragraph from your Canvas entry)*

### **What I Tried**
- 🔹 Added a **Market Table** for better segmentation.
- 🔹 Connected a **Product Category Table** for classification.
- 🔹 Standardized **Month Ending Dates** to improve clarity.

### **Key Takeaways**
- 🚀 **Data integrity is everything!** If a dataset is unclear, analysis will be too.
- 🎯 **Enhancements must be verifiable.** Sometimes, adding context isn’t enough if the raw data itself lacks structure.
- 📊 **Visualization can reveal hidden inconsistencies.** Bad data only becomes obvious when you attempt to structure it.

> **Final Thought:** Not every dataset leads to meaningful analysis, and that’s okay! The real skill lies in **knowing when to pivot** and apply lessons learned.
